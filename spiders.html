        <p>Horrible right? <br><br> Once upon a time, I used to like spiders. Now they haunt me. Once upon a time, I used to get excited to find a spider near by. I had a nice little repurposed fish tank, stocked to the brim with all manner of the garden creepers. Hunstmans, Orb Weavers, "Jumping Jacks" and anything else one might find in the dreary north of England. Now, I feel nothing but fear and the urge to combine a bottle of deodorant and a cigarette lighter, to burn the demons that terrorise me on a night.<br><br>
        It all started with my new home. A relatively recent affair. It started off innocuous enough. A large house spider darting around the floor as I went about the day. A little jarring, when something runs at the speed of light towards you, murderous intent on it's many eyes. Nothing too terrifying. Not terrifying at all, in reality. But then things escalated. In place of day times filled with jumpscares, they evolved. <br><br> Eventually, the spiders realised that they could not reach me, by simply being brave. It started with with a spider we'll call Mike. I understand the value of a Mike in a home. The big spiders kill the little spiders, the little bugs and even each other. I let Mike take up a home in the corner of my Bedroom, by the small collection of weights I pretend to use. He never bothered me until he too found a new home. I never figured out where it was. But it was closer than I would have hoped for at the time. <br><br>It all kicked off, so to speak, one random night. I lay in bed, talking on the phone whilst watching a movie. As lay there, my peripheral vision catches a slight movement over my left shoulder. I can be very attentive to slight movements. I turned to my left, expecting to find nothing. Probably just a stray hair, I thought. In place of empty space or the blurred outline of a hair, I find a common house spider. For those of you who live in Britian, you can likely attest that these things get larger than they have any right too. They move quicker than you're comfortable with and despite the general truism of such crawlers being harmless, you have a friend or relative who was bitten by one. You're reflexively cautious but perhaps not afraid. I jumped out my skin, as it ran towards to my face. Perhaps I am atouch skittish generally but this was an event that pulled my heart through my digestive tract, until it escaped out the door which cannot be entered. <br><br> It didn't end there. For the better part of 2 years, the spiders have been invading my privacy. I did not have a phobia of spiders. I don't think I do, still. It's not an irrational fear. I know, with absolute certainty, that particular population at home is out to get me. It's true. I see nothing of spiders until I'm at my most vulnerable. Laying in the dark, writing away, and BAM! I am attacked. Escaping only due to my inhuman reflexes. I lie nervously twitching each time the slight scuff on my wall appears at the corner of my eyes. The mark that has existed for a few month, reducing me to anxiety, just because it's something dark against something light. You might be wondering why I haventajusted to that blemish and it's presence. Long story short, spiders are smart. They camoflage themselves against it, on 3 occassions, I've panicked and thought, "OH, the mark..." only for the mark to seperate as the vicious little bastard darts towards my hair. <br><br> I'm not being dramatic. People will often say, "Spiders wont harm you. They are more afraid of you than you are of them!" yet there I have sat, countless nights, as a crawling demon of 8 leggedness tickles the skin on my shoulder, taunting me with those off-putting legs. They are getting bolder. Not more than a week ago, I valiantly fought off a tormenter, only for it to land in my bedding and fucking vanish. I spent hours pulling off my duvets, pillows and clearing any crevace with which they could hid in. He was never found. Nor was my peace of mind ever returned. <br><br> If there is no more nonsense coming from me, any time after this post, you can safely assume that I evaded death no longer. Or, the last remnants of sanity were stolen from me. Be cautious, you may be next. </p>
