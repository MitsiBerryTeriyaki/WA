		<p>Well. Here you are. Visiting mitsiberryteriyaki.com. Or, whatever it is we have it named at this point. You might be wondering exactly what it is, what it does and who it is for. Honestly? We haven't decided yet. It might be for you, dear reader, or it might be for only one specific person. Perhaps it's an exploration of capacity. A test of the limitaions in my knowledge, or even the limiations of code. Doubtful. The last one, that is. Can't quite imagine myself reaching a point where I can comprehend the limitations of anything programming related. <br><br> Anyway. You're probably wondering what to expect. Right? Well, don't get your hopes up. There isn't anything around yet. You're looking at step one of a potentially huge, soon to be forgotten project. It might have a convincing enough face to trick you into thinking there is content to be found. There isn't. So far. I intend to change that, as soon as I'm finished writing this up.  What will come next may be some testament to a massive ego. Don't judge too harshly. Myself is an easy topic. Other things require thought and preparation. Frankly, I'd like to avoid thinking about how to create something good in content. The fluff is important, for once. <br><br> Alas, the introduction is over. Carry on with your day. Click any number of my magical links. If they work, I'm sure they'll take you somewhere supremely uninteresting. Bye now! <3
